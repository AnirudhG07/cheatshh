# Libraries
These are pre-made libraries which you can add in your groups and commands. <br>
These groups are very broad based and not broken finely for networking, files, permission based, etc.

## How to add them in your cheatshh
These will be either present in your main directory `~/.config/cheatshh` or you'll have to download it through the <a href="https://github.com/AnirudhG07/cheatshh"> github </a> page.

1) Open the main directory using the following command
```bash
cd; cd ~/.config/cheatshh/library
```
2) Open the directory of suitable name and its `groups.json`, copy the group whichever you like. Then paste it in `~/.config/cheatshh/groups.json`.

3) It is very important to copy the commands present in the `commands.json` of the same directory as you chose. Then paste it in `~/.config/cheatshh/commands.json`.

## Note
- If you see yellow or lines under a command or group, means the name is previously present and you'll have to remove it since it's duplicate
- You can always change the description in the `commands.json` and `groups.json`, or using the built-in options-
```bash
cheatshh -ec  
# OR
cheatshh -eg
```

- You might see NEW and COOL terminal commands you might never have even heard of. Well some of them are my personal favourites and I would highly recommend you to download them as well. (They are Linux/MacOS based mostly.)

- Feel free to post your personal favourite libraries by forking the repository and creating a pull request. I'll be happy to expand this library and see more and more cool terminal utilities.
