FILES
    By default, cheatshh will create a folder in ~/.config/cheatshh where all the files and codes are stored.
    You can access it and change settings as it suits you.

    Cheatshh reads its configurations from 3 files mainly:

    cheats.sh
        This file is the main source code for the display, addition, deletion, grouping and editing.
    
    commands.json
        This file stores all the commands with their respective description and properties.

    groups.json
        This file stores all the groups made with their respective descriptions and sub-commands.

    You can download pre-made groups through the main github page at https://github.com/AnirudhG07/cheatshh.
    Simply copy paste them into your commands.json and groups.json file to make them visible.

NOTES
    Cheatshh assumes every command is unique and you cannot have more than one command with the same name.

    Deleting a group will only delete the commands of that group. If a command is common in other groups, then
    the command will not be deleted from other groups.
    Deleting a command has optional delete from a particular group or throughout the cheatsheet. 

    Select a group or a command by pressing Enter. Go back or quit the cheatshh by pressing Escape.
    On selection of a group, you will be able to see the commands present in it with custom set descriptions and
    tldr page. 
    On selection of a command, it will be copied to your clipboard automatically, and you will be prompted to exit.
